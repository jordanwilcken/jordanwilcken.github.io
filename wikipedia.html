<p><b>Jordan Wayne Wicken</b> (born August 6, 1982) is an American software developer who works to make <a href="https://www.xactware.com/en-us/solutions/claims-estimating/xactimate/professional" target="_blank">the Xactimate estimation platform</a> more delightful. He also works to make the Xactimate development team more cooperative and cohesive. He primarily codes in C#.</p>

<h2>Early life and education</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Heritage and youth</h3>
<p>Jordan Wayne Wilcken was born on August 6, 1982 in Fresno, California, one of four children born to therapist Wayne A. Wilcken and homemaker Victoria Wilcken (née Hartman). A sixth-generation member of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" target="_blank">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church), he is a great great great grandson of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Henry_Wilcken" target="_blank">Charles Henry Wilcken</a>, who converted to the faith shortly after emigrating to the United States in 1857.</p>

<p>Wilcken has three younger siblings, and is the oldest by only 14 months. He was named "Outstanding Kindergartner of the Year" in elementary school and attended 11 different public schools by the time he had graduated from high school in Farmington, New Mexico.</p>

<h3>University, Philippines mission, and marriage: 2000-04</h3>
<p>Wilcken attended The New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology during the 2000-01 academic year. While there he was part of the on-campus gaming club, and even played Dungeons and Dragons second edition. He worked part time as a custodian.</p>

<p>In September 2001 he began a twenty-four-month stint in the Philippines as a Mormon missionary. His first assignment was to Abuyog, Sorsogon City, Sorsogon. By the end of his stint in September 2003, he was overseeing the work of 7 others.</p>

<p>Wilcken first met his wife Wendi on a trip to Brigham Young University (BYU). They decided to get married about nine months later.</p>

<h3>Misadventures as a Realtor: 2004-10</h3>
<p>Wilcken's mother and siblings moved to Springville, Utah while he was away on his mission. Wilcken lived with his mother for one year following his mission, and during that time began attending BYU. At the advice of his mission president, Wilcken chose to major in chemical engineering. During his junior year at BYU, Wilcken was exposed to Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad, which was pivotal in Wilcken's decision to pause his education and pursue a career in real estate.</p>

<p>As a Realtor, Wilcken experienced mixed success. His day-to-day work consisted mainly of cold calling For Sale by Owners. Wilcken graduated from BYU after a one semester pause where he exclusively focused on real estate. When it became clear to Wilcken that his real estate career was neither fulfilling nor lucrative he attempted to secure a job in chemical engineering. It became quickly apparent that his prospects where nonexistant and Wilcken began applying to graduate schools.</p>

<h3>Graduate school: 2010-12</h3>
<p>Wilcken was admitted to the Universty of Utah's Master Games Studio program in the fall of 2010. He and his family moved from Springville to The West Village, a complex of student family housing to the southeast of campus. The Master Games Studio is a videogame development program, and Wilcken spent one year in a course of studio focused on project management. When it became apparent that entry level project management jobs in the game industry were hard to come by, Wilcken changed his emphasis to programming and completed his education at the U with a master's degree in computing.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his second year at the U, Wilcken began searching for work through the campus career placement center. He interviewed at eBay and Xactware, received a job offer from Xactware, and has worked there ever since.</p>

<h2>Software development career</h2>
<hr>

<p>Wilcken began his time at Xactware in the QA department and transitioned to development after 3 months. He has worked exclusively on Xactimate products, which are used to adjust insurance claims in various parts of the world. He believes in continuous improvement through training and has completed dozens of Pluralsight courses, which he will often recommend to his colleagues and coworkers. Wilcken has a reputation for being an expert in SQL, the command line, and unit testing. He is often asked for help in each of these areas.</p>

<p>Wilcken is widely regarded as a useful source of project knowledge and a ready ally in the face of a wide variety of technical problems. He says his greatest ambition is to make Xactimate both delightful to use and delightful to develop and maintain.</p>

<h3>Influence on team culture</h3>
<p></p>
null averseness
unit testing
simplifying - single repo, simpler build
more frequent releases
IoC

<p>Wilcken is mainly responsible for the introduction of paired programming to the development team he works among. A practice he was converted to during a job interview.</p>

<p>Wilcken is an opinionated and outspoken advocate of functional programming principles. He has expressed fondness for the Elm programming language and has even given presentations and blogged about it.</p>

<!--<h3>Campaign for new PDF engine</h3>
<p>By all inside accounts, Xactimate is a gigantic old desktop application built atop a large legacy codebase. One of the program's core features is presenting insurance claim information in PDF form. The legacy code upon which this feature currently stands is brittle and costly to maintain. Concerned by this mission critical technical debt, Wilcken has persuaded development and management to adopt a newer, more flexible PDF engine, built primarily atop existing proven technologies instead of being developed in-house. It is projected that all major PDF-related undertakings will be based upon the engine that Wilcken has recently roughed out.</p>

<h3>Campaign to keep Slack</h3>
<p>In March of 2018 rumors began circulating that Xactware would abandon Slack for Microsoft Teams, which had recently become part of Office 365. The reason: cost-cutting. Wilcken is a vocal proponent of Slack and solicited the vice president of the Xactimate division for support in continuing its use. That support was granted, but upper management declared that Slack use would be discontinued anyway. Wilcken did not join his peers on Teams, and continues devoutly on Slack in the form of protest. He has said that if the consensus among the department had been to change messengers then he could go along with it. Since the mandate to switch came from upper management he opted to protest.</p>-->
