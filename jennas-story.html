<p>I published this on Valentine's day in 2019. It seems an appropriate day for publishing a story like this.</p>

<p>I grew up during an interesting time in American History. Interesting because California elementary schools - or at least the one I went to - hosted concession stands on certain afternoons. I was too young to think very hard about it at the time, but I believe the intent was to raise funds by selling candy to small children. This was the late 80's, so maybe we hadn't discovered yet that candy isn't good for you?</p>

<p>Whatever the case, the first law of childhood economics states that when you have money, you trade it for candy as soon as possible. So one day (after school) I engaged my nascent planning-for-the-future skills to round up an appreciable amount of loose change in anticipation of concession stand.</p>

<p>The next day at school I was feeling really confident leadingup to concession stand. I just knew I was gonna get a bunch of great stuff. I shook those coins several times during the day, and was highly satisfied with their sound. But when the anticipated moment of concessions finally came, my money wasn't there. I checked all of the pockets in my hooded sweatshirt several times, but it was lost. My first fortune: Lost. I was feeling glum. And that's when my best friend's sister, Jenna, noticed me.</p>

<p>"Don't you have any money for candy, Jordan?" She asked me. Or something like that. I can't really remember. But I do remember that when she found out I didn't have any money she bought a big red Jolly Rancher for me, and all I could think about for the rest of the day was how good the candy tasted and how nice Jenna was. And more-than-25 years later I still think about this nice thing that Jenna did for me.</p>

<p>I found the money not long after I got home from school. I think it spilled out of one of the sleeves of my sweatshirt when I took it off. I'm pretty sure I just forgot all about it right away. What's the point of keeping track of money if there isn't any candy nearby to trade it for?</p>

<p>Today I'm hoping that I can repay Jenna for her kindness. So if you see someone who looks like she might be my first-grade-best-friend's older sister, would you please do something nice for her?</p>
