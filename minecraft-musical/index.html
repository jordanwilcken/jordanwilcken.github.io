    <h1>Minecraft the Musical</h1>
    <h2>Act 1. Scene 1.</h2>

    <p>An actor playing the part of The Menu stands at the front center of an otherwise empty stage. The actor playing the part of The Menu holds up a large sign that looks somewhat like the title menu in Minecraft.
    </p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>(Saying things like the Minecraft menu always does) As seen on TV!</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Limited edition!</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Now with difficulty!</p>

    <p>Minecraft Steve enters stage left and walks uncertainly toward The Menu.</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Bringing home the bacon!</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>Excuse me, sir.</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>I am the menu.</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>Um, your sign says Minecraft. Is this how I get into Minecraft?</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Absolutely no memes! This isn't a sign. Don't you know I'm The Menu?</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>The Menu?</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Yes, the menu to Minecraft. Gateway to adventure! Trail marker of all things awesome!</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>(says nothing)</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>I can tell you're confused. You want to play Minecraft, right?</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>Yes, that's right!</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>First you have to pick a name for the world I'm going to create for you. Then you have to decide if you are going to play in Survival Mode or on Peaceful. Then I'll generate a world for you and you can play.</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>Uh, I'm sorry, I've never played before. I don't understand.</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Newcomer, eh? I'll make this easy for you. Say, "I want my world to be named 'Wow! The Menu is super awesome!'"</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>(stares at The Menu. He doesn't understand.)</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>(Repeating himself, trying to be patient) Say, "I want my world to be named 'Wow! The Menu is super awesome!'"</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>(After hesitating) Uh, I want my world to be named 'Wow! The Menu is super awesome!'</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Done! Now, do you want to play Survival or Peaceful?</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>Uh...</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Do you want there to be enemies? Do you want to get blown up by creepers?</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>Well, I don't know about creepers, but yeah, I think it'll be more fun with enemies.</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Ok! Generating world. You might want to have a seat, this'll takes a minute. I'm not allowed to show you how I make the world, but I am going to sing to you about it.</p>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>You're going to sing to me?</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Don't you know anything? This is musical theater! It's got to have songs! Don't worry, I'll take care of this first one. You might want to take some notes.</p>

    <p>The Menu sings "In the beginning". A song about creating a Minecraft world.</p>

    <em>
        In the beginning<br/>
        was The Menu<br/>
        and The Menu was good<br/>
        and The Menu said "let there be dirt!" and there was<br/>
        lots of dirt, and there was<br/>
        dirt for farming and digging and more!<br/>
        But really the purpose for all of this dirt is<br/>
        to take all that dirt and make fun!<br/>
    </em><br/>
    <em>
        In the begining</br>
        was The Menu</br>
        and The Menu said "let there be trees" in that dirt</br>
        lovely trees and there were</br>
        trees for wood that's for crafting much more!</br>
        But really the purpose for all of that wood is</br>
        to take that wood and make fun!</br>
    </em><br/>
    <em>
        In the beginning<br/>
        was the menu<br/>
        and the menu said "let there be lava that burns"<br/>
        water too, and there was 6<br/>
        blocks for building a portal to hell!<br/>
        But really the purpose for all of these blocks is<br/>
        to take all these blocks and make fun!<br/>
    </em><br/>
    <em>
        In the beginning<br/>
        was the menu<br/>
        and the menu said "let there be redstone for building machines!"<br/>
        Cool machines! And there was<br/>
        redstone pistons and droppers and rails<br/>
        But really the purpose for all of that red is<br/>
        to take all that red and make fun!<br/>
    </em><br/>
    <em>
        In the beginning<br/>
        was the menu<br/>
        and the menu completed your world.<br/>
        Filled it up with adventure and spots for explorin -<br/>
        a place of excitement, should never be borin' -<br/>
        I hope you remember, the thing that's importan:<br/>
        that really the purpose for all of this world is<br/>
        to take this new world and make fun!<br/>
    </em>

    <p><b>Steve: </b>(looking at the new Minecraft world that's been created) Wow! Looks great!</p>

    <p><b>The Menu: </b>Of course it does! You think this is my first time? Enjoy! And watch out for creepers!</p>

    <p>Steve enters the world of Minecraft. End of scene 1.</p>
