<h1>My friend is mad by Jordan Wilcken</h1>
<p>I have a friend at work who sees malice in some of our other coworkers. While he doesn't exactly know what their agendas are, he is sure that these coworkers are deliberately violating the rules of our process and harming our product. He secretly questions their competence. He has become noticeably passive aggressive. He transferred to a different department to get away from the situation, but I'm told he still thinks and talks a lot about his old team.</p>

<p>"At one job I had to keep a text file named 'ThingsIAmRightAbout.txt' in order to keep track of all the things I could rub in peoples' faces later when they learned how right I was."</p>
<p>"Another time I was super frustrated with a coworker - they really annoyed me - so I had to tell everybody about it. Behind this person's back. And then one day they pulled me aside, and I thought, 'Uh oh. Found out. Here it comes.' And then this coworker sincerely thanked me for being a nice person and for taking extra time to help out wherever it was needed. I felt like garbage."</p>
<p>"I wanted there to be an evil boss or something outside of me that was responsible for my problems. But it was me."</p>

<h1>The Touch of the Master's Hand by Myra Brooks Welch</h1>
<pre>Twas battered and scarred, and the auctioneer

Thought it scarcely worth his while

To waste much time on the old violin,

But held it up with a smile:

"What am I bidden, good folks," he cried,

"Who'll start the bidding for me?"

"A dollar, a dollar"; then, "Two!" "Only two?

Two dollars, and who'll make it three?

Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;

Going for three " But no,

From the room, far back, a gray-haired man

Came forward and picked up the bow;

Then, wiping the dust from the old violin,

And tightening the loose strings,

He played a melody pure and sweet

As a caroling angel sings.

The music ceased, and the auctioneer,

With a voice that was quiet and low,

Said, "What am I bid for the old violin?"

And he held it up with the bow.

"A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?

Two thousand! And who'll make it three?

Three thousand, once, three thousand, twice,

And going, and gone!" said he.

The people cheered, but some of them cried,

"We do not quite understand

What changed its worth." Swift came the reply:

"The touch of a master's hand."

And many a man with life out of tune,

And battered and scarred with sin,

Is auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd,

Much like the old violin.

A "mess of pottage," a glass of wine,

A game and he travels on.

He's "going" once, and "going" twice,

He's "going" and almost "gone."

But the Master comes, and the foolish crowd

Never can quite understand

The worth of a soul and the change that's wrought

By the touch of the Master's hand.</pre>

<h1>Story About His Primary President by President Monson</h1>
<p>One winter day as Christmas approached, I thought back to an experience from my boyhood. I was eleven. Our Primary president, Melissa, was an older and loving gray-haired lady.</p>
<p>One day at Primary, Melissa asked me to stay behind and visit with her. The two of us sat in the otherwise empty chapel. She placed her arm about my shoulder and began to cry. Surprised, I asked her why she was crying. She replied: 
"
I don't seem to be able to encourage the Trail Builder [now Blazer] boys to be reverent during the opening exercises of Primary. Would you be willing to help me, Tommy?"</p>
<p>I promised her I would. Strangely to me, but not to Melissa, that ended any problem of reverence in that Primary. She had gone to the source of the problem - me. The solution was love.</p>
<p>The years flew by. Marvelous Melissa, now in her nineties, lived in a nursing [home] in the northwest part of Salt Lake City. Just before Christmas, I determined to visit my beloved Primary president.</p>
			<p>I found Melissa in the lunchroom. She stared at her plate of food, teasing it with the fork she held in her aged hand. Not a bite did she eat. As I spoke to her, my words were met with a blank stare. I took the fork in hand and began to feed Melissa, talking all the time I did so about her service to boys and girls as a Primary worker. There wasn't so much as a glimmer of recognition, far less a spoken word.</p>
			<p>Two other residents of the nursing home gazed at me with puzzled expressions. At last they spoke, saying: "She doesn't know anyone, even her own. She hasn't said a word in all the time she's been here."</p>
			<p>Lunch ended. My one-sided conversation wound down. I stood to leave. I held her frail hand in mine, gazed into her wrinkled but beautiful countenance, and said: "God bless you, Melissa. Merry Christmas." Without warning, she spoke the words: "I know you. You're Tommy Monson, my Primary boy. How I love you."</p
