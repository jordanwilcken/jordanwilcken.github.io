What makes good writing?

I think there are lots of ingredients, and color is one of them. Compelling details. Imagination-inducing immersion. My back yard, for example, is a pitiful yard. We wanted to take care of it once, but we didn’t have the time or the know-how. It’s 60% patchy grass, 10% garden boxes (which don’t like bad), 10% weeds, 10% disorderly woodpile , 8% things-that-would-be-beautiful-if-they-weren’t-slowly-decaying-or-dying, and 2% dog poops. All atop a thin, well-drained layer of sand and small rocks. There’s a crabgrass corner. A sand-n-weeds corner. A disorderly woodpile corner. And an odd mound comprised entirely of dead sod - let’s call it Frankenhill. It’s not long for a Frankenstein to be buried there, but if Frankenstein were to magically transform into a mound of dead sod, that’s about what he’d look like. Also, a couple of water barrels which have been laying on their sides near the fence for months.

Enough about color, it’s time to move on to voice. Jake introduced me to this concept. It’s the tone and the emotion and the formality of the words. The meaning that’s added by how you said what you said. The style of your expression.

Lastly (this is not an exhaustive list), there’s the novelty. The creativity of your expression. The metaphor and the improv and the originality of your language. I think it’s gotta be fresh.

But I’m no expert on the subject. What do you think makes good writing?
