<h1>Want to believe? Struggling to believe? Jesus will help you.</h1>
<p>God is mysterious, and so is life. You and I are meaning makers, and we try to understand everything, and sometimes it's hard to reconcile new knowledge with the stories we want to tell ourselves. For example, we want to believe that people are basically good at heart. It's a nice story, and our experience mostly corroborates it, but some of what we see in the world makes us doubt. Even if we don't doubt, we might wonder. It will almost certainly require effort to keep believing this story. Some of what we learn will be difficult to reconcile. But such is the nature of our existence here. We know more than we understand. We live out our lives with imperfect and incomplete information. That's why I referred to our belief in the goodness of people as a story. It's not something we can be entirely final about. We've got evidence, sure, but we can't entirely prove it.</p>

<p>We <em>can</em> know some things with finality. Was President Obama really born in Hawaii? Is the earth's climate really changing? Both of these claims are eminently checkable. But for all that we know or can know, there is a great deal more that we don't or currently can't.</p>

<p>So it is with the story of God. Is there proof? Yes. And you probably have experience that confirms the story too. But you probably can't entirely reconcile every tragic or random thing that happens with this good, useful, plausible story. But that's expected. We even have a name for this situation where you believe even though you can't understand it all. It's called <em>faith.</em></p>

<p>So how does Jesus help with faith in God? Look at his life on this earth. One of the things that he did here was to show us what God our Father is like. The Apostle Philip once said to him, "Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us." Jesus saith unto him, "Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." Jesus shows us our Father.</p>

<p>I think that it's easier to believe in God when you have a correct knowledge of who he is. We have <em>The Bible</em> and other scriptures to help with that. Jesus is God, and he knows perfectly what it's like to be you and me. He's experienced everything we are going through. He had faith. And he held on to his faith even when he couldn't understand every bad thing that was happening to him. "My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?" That's what he said.</p>

<p>His life is proof for the existence of God, and what's more, it is proof of a loving God. Proof of a compassionate God. Proof of a God who wants to save everyone. A God worth believing in. A God who is watching over us even when we feel abandoned. Look at the death of Jesus Christ. It was a lonely and agonizing experience for him. A soul-crushing experience for those who believed in him. It looked like a victory for evil. And God was silent during the whole thing. Conspicuously absent. Good Friday ended with Jesus buried. Saturday came and went like any other Saturday. But Sunday morning brought resurrection and the dawn of understanding. Jesus returned to his mourning friends glorified and victorious, and reminded them that he'd told them that all this would happen beforehand. In spite of what it looked like when Jesus was hanging abandoned on the cross Friday afternoon, evil had not won, and God was not absent. Instead, God had given Jesus all power over death. Through the life and death of his son, Jesus, God was showing us who he is and how he loves us.</p>

<p>So if you need help believing in God, just look at Jesus Christ. Try (or adapt) this exercise: For the next seven days, spend 20 minutes each morning studying the life of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. What did Jesus teach us about the nature of God? What did he show us about the nature of God? Make a record of what you learn.</p>
