<h1>A Brief Report on Net Neutrality</h1>

<p>I wanted to understand Internet neutrality better so I've spent the last week (when I could find time) learning more about it. This report is the culmination of my exercise.</p>

<h2>Net neutrality: What's the big idea?</h2>

<p>The idea of Internet neutrality is that all information and consumers of information should be treated the same. No preferred or special treatment for anyone or any particular Internet offering. No fast lanes or slow lanes. All information flowing through the system as quickly and efficiently as possible. Sounds good, right? We are a culture and a country that really likes equal.</p>

<h2>What is the story of net neutrality?</h2>

<p>The Internet is a very large computer network. And most of the computers holding up that network belong to Internet service providers: Big companies that are out for money. Comcast and Verizon, for example. If the Internet service providers can control how information flows through the Internet, they can make more money. And the Internet becomes a worser place in the process. It becomes less of a tool for connection. More of a tool for control.</p>

<p>We've already seen examples of Internet service providers abusing their power. But some people see it different. They see legitimate <em>use</em> of power, not <em>abuse</em> of power. They think that if you own the computers that hold up the Internet, you should be able to do what you want with them. Free country, right? You could compare using the Internet to renting an apartment. If your landlord doesn't want you to have pets, you don't have pets. You don't have to agree to the pet policy, and you can always live somewhere else.</p>

<p>But to me that seems like a dismal future for the Internet. I don't think there should be a landlord. The Internet should be a place where anyone can share cool stuff with anyone. I think an Internet beholden to corporate America would look something like this:</p>

<p>Whatever your position on Internet neutrality, I think we all want an Internet that looks more like this:</p>

<p>I hope you agree that the Internet should be awesome. And I hope you agree that nerfing the Internet would be real bad.</p>

<p>...but getting back to our story, we can already see examples of Internet service providers abusing their powers. There have already been legal battles over what an Internet service provider can and cannot do to the Internet, and there will doubtless be more.</p>

<p>Many feel that the government should have some say over the Internet - that there ought to be laws that will keep our Internet unicorn beautiful and free. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission or FCC, seems like an obvious choice for Internet protection and rule-making. The FCC has tried to do that, but are currently in a state that they can't.</p>

<p>Ajit Pai, current chairman of the FCC, and his republican co-commisioners have decided that the FCC should not have power to regulate Internet service providers. He says that if we're going to have rules for the Internet, they ought to come from legislators chosen by the people. And that's a reasonable thing to say. It is common to lack confidence in our government, and I think we generally prefer to be governed by people we elect, and not by people that were appointed by the people that we elect. And I guess that's one general problem with having government oversight for the Internet: As bad as corporate America might nerf the Internet, you might fear that government regulation would nerf it worse.</p>

<p>But I'm not so cynical about our government and our political process. I disagree with a lot that happens, but I believe it's possible to pass good laws, and I think laws protecting Internet neutrality would be good.</p>

<p>That's about it for my abridged story of net neutrality. The republicans in the FCC have decided that the FCC should not be regulating the Internet, but the dispute isn't over. Maybe it never will be. Hopefully we can agree that something should be done to keep the Internet free and healthy.</p>

<h2>How long has this net neutrality debate been going on?</h2>

<p>A long time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a> has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081227100511/http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/144" target="_blank">talking about it</a> since at least 2006.</p>

<h2>Who is Ajit Pai, and why does he care about Internet policy?</h2>

<p>Ajit Pai was appointed to the Federal Communications Commission by President Obama in 2012. In 2017 he was appointed chairmain of the commission by President Trump. He worked for the FCC for several years before becoming a commissioner. He is the star of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFhT6H6pRWg" target="_blank">this video</a>, and I wish he wasn't part of the FCC. I think that his contribution to this discussion about Internet equality has been a negative one. Condescending towards those who disagree with him. His term ends in 2021.</p>

<h2>What powers does the FCC have?</h2>

<p>There's a copy of the United States code on the purposes of the FCC at <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/151" target="_blank">this link</a>. Based on my reading, I think the FCC does have a place in the realm of Internet regulation. But of course there was no Internet at the time the FCC was created.</p>

<h2>What sources did I use in my research for this report?</h2>

<p>Mostly Wikipedia.</p>
