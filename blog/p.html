<li>I heard this from Elder Jeffrey D. Erekson, my companion in a stake conference in Idaho. As a young married elder, desperately poor and feeling unable to finish his last year of college, Jeffrey decided to drop out and accept an attractive job offer. A few days later his elders quorum president came to his home. "Do you understand the significance of the priesthood keys I hold?" the elders quorum president asked. When Jeffrey said he did, the president told him that since hearing of his intention to drop out of college, the Lord had tormented him during sleepless nights to give Jeffrey this message: "As your elders quorum president, I counsel you not to drop out of college. That is a message to you from the Lord." Jeffrey stayed in school. Years later I met him when he was a successful businessman and heard him tell an audience of priesthood holders, "That [counsel] has made all the difference in my life."</li>

<li>If fathers would magnify their priesthood in their own family, it would further the mission of the Church as much as anything else they might do.</li>

<li>Cultivate loving relationships so that family members will want to ask you for blessings. Parents should encourage more priesthood blessings in the family.</li>

<li>Behold, there are many called, but few are chosen. And why are they not chosen? Because their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men, that they do not learn this one lesson - 
That the rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness. That they may be conferred upon us, it is true; but when we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or ddominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves; the Spirit of the Lord is grieved; and when it is withdrawn, Amen to the priesthood or the authority of that man.</li>

<li>No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile</li>

<li>God's work is to exalt and perfect his children. Priesthood is power that God delegates for accomplishing that work.</li>

<li>The offices and orders of the priesthood are appointments to humble service in the work of the Master.</li>

<li>"We are laboring for the salvation of souls, and we should feel that this is the greatest duty devolving upon us. Therefore, we should feel willing to sacrifice everything, if need be, for the love of God, the salvation of men, and the triumph of the kingdom of God upon the earth."

<li>When the Apostles conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood upon Joseph and Oliver, they also gave them the keys to direct its exercise. But not all priesthood keys were conferred at that time. The entire keys and knowledge necessary for this "dispensation of the fulness of times" are given "line upon line". Additional keys were given in the Kirtland Temple seven years later. These keys were given to direct priesthood authority in the additional assignments being given at that time, such as baptism for the dead.</li>

<li>The most important principle for all priesthood holders is the principle taught by the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob: "And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence".
