<h1>Encouraging Words</h1>
<p>Earlier this week I was snowboarding down a mountain. I was learning, and in the course of trying something new I fell down. As I was getting up, someone who had been watching me from the passing ski lift called down a few encouraging words. But they were powerful. They significantly altered my emotional state then, and I'm still thinking about them now. And I wondered then, "Why did those simple words have such a powerful effect on me?"</p>

<p>I think the main reason these encouraging words were so powerful is that I believed the person speaking them truly understood me. But why would I believe that a complete stranger truly understood me? For one thing, we were both engaged in the same challenge. We were both trying to slide gracefully down the side of the same mountain. What's more, I had partially succeeded in the new thing I had been trying when I fell down. I was making progress, and my confidence was already growing. This person's words confirmed and amplified what I was already feeling about the success of my efforts. And what's more, this person was focused entirely on the positive. Though I was getting up from a fall, the only thing mentioned was the progress I had made.</p>

<p>I don't know how skilled this person on the ski lift was. I did not see them, and I don't know if we ever passed each other on the mountain after that. But because he understood me so well, I assume that he's quite skilled. How else could he have recognized the progress in what otherwise looked like a failure? Encouragement and recognition from an expert carry more weight, and so his words were self-reinforcing.</p>

<p>I don't think the stranger on the ski lift knows how powerful he was. And now I know that I can do the same.</p>

<p>And so do you.</p>

<h2>The part where I turn to religion. You knew it was coming.</h2>

<p>I believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God; that he saves us from our sins and gives us the power to become our best selves. At some point after we die we will meet him and look into his eyes and know that he understands us perfectly. And the love that we feel for him will be overpowering. We will know that through all of our many falls he was watching us and encouraging us in our progress.</p>
